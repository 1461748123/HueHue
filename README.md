- Rainbow color effects.
- Realtime music reactive color based on the default Windows audio device.
- "Snake" colors.

- Alternating colors, with various animations.
- Maybe even a scripting mode where you can program a effect manualy using the 50/50 LED strips.
- Better UI and user experience, with auto updating and etc.
- Sync effects with existing RGB hardware including Corsair, Logitech and Razer keyboards and mouses, or even Philips Hue Lights. 
- Auto change effects when a determined software starts running

#### What it will do maybe:
- Sync lights with games
